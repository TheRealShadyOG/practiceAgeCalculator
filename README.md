# practiceAgeCalculator
So this is another project I thought of to get some pactice and experience. A calculator that will give you the years, months, days, hours, minutes, or seconds that youve been alive. Not planning on making hours, minutes, or seconds 100% accurate. Just basically converting the days into hours, minutes, or seconds.
